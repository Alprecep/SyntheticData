# SyntheticData
This file explains how the code works.
The data is reshaped into daily baches and fed to the neural network. Then prediction is reshaped into yearly data. 
Synthetic generation and real wind speeds are plotted

synthetic.mat file contains the synthetically generated wind speed data for year 2.
Rerunning the code will generate different noise input to neural network leading to generate different synthetic data.
